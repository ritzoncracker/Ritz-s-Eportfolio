      <p class="desc">Back when I was a freshman, I took two classes in astronomy to fulfill the natural science requirement for my degree. I adore the universe and its endless wonders, which made lab even more fun. Often times I would come across reoccurring equations that would need precision in numbers and significant digits. So, in efforts to save time and work my skill, I first coded astoronomy calculators in Java. Wanting to visualize and share it with my peers, I transferred it to HTML/CSS and worked my hand at JS for the first time. And, to play with colours of course!</p>
      <p class="desc">When it's opened in a full window, you'll notice that it doesn't quite fit to the screen and looks atrocious on a phone. This was before I learned HTML/CSS better and while I could fix it to be more reactive, I like to have this serve as a reminder of a progress point. I think here was when the spark to dive further into HTML/CSS came along.</p>
      <p class="desc">No, the ask box doesn't do anything. That was another test for input boxes.</p>

      <h3 id="P3" class="cont_desc">CIVIL AIR PATROL: Operations Plan for Cadet Staff Selection</h3>
      <p class="desc">During my time as Cadet Commander in my Civil Air Patrol squadron, there was a time where the squadron needed new staff to accommodate growth. The fashion in which the staff selection process went in the past was never formally documented or outlined. So, I took it upon myself to create a formal Operations Plan in accordance with Civil Air Patrol documentation standards. This plan was tailored to the needs of our squadron at the time but even now can be used in special cicumstances such as not having enough cadet offcers to fill flight commander positions, etc.</p>

I chose to focus on the legal side of cybersecurity. It is a series of three short essays, overall grouped into one 29-page paper titled <i>A Few Legal and Practical Challenges in the Investigation of Cybercrime</i></p>

      <p class="desc">I'm a big fan of quizzing games, and sometimes I miss my high school chemistry class. So, to test my skill in python, I created a quiz game to have some fun with! I tested my knowledge on the following python programming concepts: lists, functions, if/while loops, and code organization.</p>
